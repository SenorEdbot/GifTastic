Sports Generator using Giphy API
This web application will allow users to browse the top 10 trending gifs for whatever the sport they want. 

    I have preloaded the page with 15 of the most common sports for the user's convenience. 
    The gifs will be paused initially and the user can click on them to play them at their convenience. 
    The user will be able to add sports to the search buttons whenever they want. 
    If a user likes a gif they can 'Favorite' the gif and have it play on repeat on their page, even if they search something else.
    The user can remove a favorite by clicking on the repeating gif.
